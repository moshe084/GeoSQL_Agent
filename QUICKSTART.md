# ⚡ Quick Start Guide - 5 Minutes to Demo

Get the Geo-SQL Agent running in under 5 minutes!

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Docker installed
- [ ] Docker Compose installed
- [ ] OpenAI API key (get one at https://platform.openai.com)
- [ ] 5 minutes of your time

## 🚀 Setup (3 steps)

### Step 1: Clone and Configure (1 min)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MasterRepo

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
nano .env  # or use any editor
```

**Add this line to `.env`:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

### Step 2: Launch (2 min)

```bash
# Make startup script executable
chmod +x run.sh

# Start all services
./run.sh
```

**OR manually with Docker Compose:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Step 3: Test (2 min)

**Open in browser:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3010
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

**Try your first query:**
```
Find all cafes within 200 meters of the largest park
```

**Watch the magic happen!** 🪄

## ✅ Verify Installation

### Check all services are running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see 3 containers:
- `geo-sql-postgis` (database)
- `geo-sql-backend` (API)
- `geo-sql-frontend` (web UI)

### Test the API directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}
```

### Check database has data:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/schema
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "tables": {
    "cafes": {"count": 15, ...},
    "parks": {"count": 7, ...},
    "roads": {"count": 6, ...}
  }
}
```

## 🎯 First Queries to Try

Copy-paste these into the app:

### 1. Simple List
```
Show me all cafes
```
*Expected: 15 cafes on the map*

### 2. Spatial Filter
```
Show all parks larger than 5000 square meters
```
*Expected: 6 large parks*

### 3. Distance Query
```
Find cafes within 200 meters of the largest park
```
*Expected: 3-4 cafes near Yarkon Park*

### 4. Complex Join
```
What is the closest cafe to the smallest park?
```
*Expected: 1 cafe with distance*

### 5. Multi-table Query
```
Find cafes near main roads
```
*Expected: Several cafes along major streets*

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Wait for PostGIS to initialize (can take 10-30 seconds)
docker-compose logs -f postgis

# Look for: "database system is ready to accept connections"
```

### Problem: "OpenAI API error"

**Check your API key:**
```bash
# Verify .env has valid key
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Should show: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Key doesn't start with `sk-`
- Extra spaces in `.env` file
- Key has expired or no credits

### Problem: Port already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Change ports in docker-compose.yml
# Default ports: 5432 (db), 8000 (api), 3010 (frontend)

# Or stop conflicting services:
docker ps  # find conflicting container
docker stop <container-id>
```

### Problem: Frontend shows but queries fail

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

**Verify network connectivity:**
```bash
# From frontend, API should be reachable
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## 🔄 Common Commands

### View logs:
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f postgis
```

### Restart services:
```bash
# Restart everything
docker-compose restart

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Stop everything:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Stop and remove data:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Rebuild after code changes:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📊 Understanding the Results

When you execute a query, you'll see:

1. **SQL Console** (left panel, bottom):
   - The actual PostGIS SQL query generated by AI
   - Learn PostGIS syntax by reading these!

2. **Map** (right panel):
   - Blue markers = cafes
   - Purple polygons = parks
   - Purple lines = roads
   - Click any marker for details

3. **Stats** (bottom right of map):
   - **Results:** Number of features returned
   - **Execution Time:** How long the query took

## 🎓 Learning Path

**Day 1: Basics**
- Try all example queries
- Read the generated SQL
- Understand ST_DWithin vs ST_Intersects

**Day 2: Customization**
- Add your own data
- Modify the system prompt
- Change map styling

**Day 3: Advanced**
- Add new tables
- Implement new spatial functions
- Create custom visualizations

## 🎬 Recording Your Demo

### Screen Recording Setup:

1. **Split screen view:**
   - Left: Browser with app (http://localhost:3010)
   - Right: Terminal with logs (`docker-compose logs -f backend`)

2. **What to show:**
   - Type a natural language question
   - Generated SQL appears in console
   - Results populate on map

3. **Timeline (30 seconds):**
   - 0-5s: Show the problem (complex PostGIS query)
   - 5-10s: Show the solution (your app)
   - 10-20s: Execute 2-3 queries
   - 20-30s: Show the architecture/code

### Recording Tools:
- **macOS:** QuickTime, ScreenFlow
- **Windows:** OBS Studio, Camtasia
- **Linux:** OBS Studio, SimpleScreenRecorder
